# Multi-robot Systems (MRS)
 
![Multi-robot Systems](/profile/mrs_github.png)

[Multi-robot Systems (MRS) group](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/) at [Department of Cybernetics](https://cyber.felk.cvut.cz), [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/en/), [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) integrates various research disciplines required for design, implementation, experimental evaluation and application of complex robotic systems. Research streams followed by MRS group members include motion and trajectory planning, locomotion generation, control, communication, coordination, and stabilization of ground, aerial, and modular robot groups. From the application point of view, MRS deals with safety-critical systems, environment monitoring by swarms of micro aerial vehicles, self-stabilized convoys of ground and aerial robots, and search & rescue topics of modular robotics. Our team of Bc., Msc., and Phd. students and senior researchers cooperate to reach a common goal: deployment and application of multi-robot systems in real-world demanding environments.

We are always looking for strongly motivated Ph.D. and undergraduate students. We often have an opening for post-doc positions. If you are interested in what we are doing and want to join us, send your resume to [Martin Saska](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/members/martin-saska).
