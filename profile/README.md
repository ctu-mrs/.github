# Multi-robot Systems (MRS)
 
![Multi-robot Systems](/profile/mrs_github.png)

[Multi-robot Systems (MRS) group](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/) at [Department of Cybernetics](https://cyber.felk.cvut.cz), [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/en/), [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) integrates various research disciplines required for design, implementation, experimental evaluation, and application of complex robotic systems. Research streams followed by MRS group members include motion and trajectory planning, locomotion generation, control, communication, coordination, and stabilization of ground, aerial, and modular robotics groups. From the application point of view, MRS deals with safety-critical systems, environment monitoring by swarms of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), self-stabilized convoys of ground and aerial robots, and search & rescue topics of modular robotics. Our team of Bc., Msc., and Ph.D. students and senior researchers cooperate to reach a common goal: deploying and applying multi-robot systems in real-world challenging environments.

We welcome highly motivated Ph.D. and undergraduate students and occasionally offer post-doc positions. If you're interested in our work and wish to join us, please submit your resume  to [Martin Saska](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/members/martin-saska).
